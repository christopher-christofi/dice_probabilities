# dice_probabilities
Dice rolls, frequency, and probability theory.

Features:
- Python 3
- Random module
- Probaility Theory

Small practice program that calculates the frequency of the accumulative of two random dice rolls. The expected roll frequency, in accordance to probaility theory, has also been accounted for. The total roll count (default: 1000) and the dice sides enumeration (default: 6) can be successfully altered without disrupting the program functionality, as well as, an accurate result in displayed table format.

Plans:
- User input for dice probability game parameters
- GUI for results
